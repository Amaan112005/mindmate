MindMate's architecture represents an innovative fusion of monolithic efficiency and microservice flexibility, implemented through five meticulously designed layers that work in concert to deliver a robust mental health platform. The Presentation Layer, constructed with Python 3.11.4 and Streamlit 1.22.0, incorporates our proprietary UI framework that enhances native components with advanced features including WCAG 2.1 AA-compliant accessibility controls with screen reader optimizations, dynamic theme switching with system preference detection, a state management system inspired by Redux but optimized for Streamlit's reactive model, and intelligent progressive loading for data-intensive visualizations that automatically adapt to network conditions.

At the heart of the system, the Application Layer implements a refined hexagonal architecture pattern with precisely 28 specialized modules (such as mood_analysis_v2 and therapy_rpg_engine) that maintain strict domain boundaries while enabling seamless cross-module communication through our custom-built asynchronous command bus system. This layer features a sophisticated dependency injection container that supports both singleton and request-scoped services, along with adaptive circuit breakers that implement exponential backoff strategies for external service calls. The architecture includes comprehensive health check endpoints for each module and implements the outbox pattern for reliable event processing.

The Service Layer provides critical infrastructure capabilities including a high-performance WebSocket service built on uvloop that handles 500+ concurrent connections with sub-50ms latency, a distributed batch processing engine using Celery with Redis backend for analytics workloads, a PDF generation service supporting accessible PDF/UA standards, a secure file upload handler with virus scanning integration, and a multi-channel notification system supporting email (with MJML templates), SMS (via Twilio), and WebPush (with VAPID authentication). All services implement retry policies with jitter and implement distributed tracing through OpenTelemetry.

For data management, we've engineered a sophisticated polyglot persistence architecture featuring PostgreSQL 14.5 with TimescaleDB for time-series data, MongoDB 6.0.6 with sharded clusters for document storage, and Redis 7.0.11 with RedisJSON for caching and real-time features. The data layer implements field-level encryption using AWS KMS with regional key replication, along with row-level security policies in PostgreSQL and document-level access controls in MongoDB. Our custom ORM layer includes change data capture capabilities and supports both optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control models.

The Integration Layer provides comprehensive external connectivity through versioned REST APIs (documented with OpenAPI 3.1.0 specifications), a performant GraphQL endpoint with persisted queries for mobile clients, a webhook system with HMAC verification, and HL7 FHIR R4 interfaces for EHR integration. All external interfaces implement rate limiting using a token bucket algorithm and include comprehensive request validation with JSON Schema.

Security is implemented through a defense-in-depth approach featuring mutual TLS 1.3 for all internal service communication, hardware security modules (AWS CloudHSM) for cryptographic operations, GDPR and HIPAA-compliant audit trails with 90-day immutable storage, automated penetration testing integrated into our CI/CD pipeline, and runtime application self-protection (RASP) capabilities. The system implements just-in-time access provisioning and includes a comprehensive secrets management system with automatic rotation.

Deployment architecture supports multiple environments including Kubernetes clusters (EKS) with horizontal pod autoscaling, Docker Compose for local development with hot-reload capabilities, and Terraform 1.3.7 modules for infrastructure-as-code. We support blue/green deployments with canary analysis through our custom traffic shifting controller and implement multi-region failover with RTO <5 minutes through our active-active regional deployment strategy.

Observability is comprehensive, featuring distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry 1.18.0, custom Prometheus exporters for business metrics, security anomaly detection using machine learning models trained on historical patterns, and an automated log analysis pipeline that implements both rule-based and anomaly detection for operational issues while maintaining compliance through real-time PII redaction.
